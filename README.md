# raytracer-hs

Parallel ray tracer based on the [Raytracing in one weekend](https://raytracing.github.io/books/RayTracingInOneWeekend.html).

Even though this is a Cabal project, the only dependency that is not available with a [default installation of GHC](https://downloads.haskell.org/ghc/8.10.2/docs/html/users_guide/8.10.2-notes.html#included-libraries) is the [parallel] library. 
Thus, this project can be easily adapted to run by using just a standard GHC installation.
